# CSCI2270FinalProjectPark
## Project Summary

For this project, I am going to create a shopping program to allow a user to:
1. Add an item, 
2. Delete an item 
3. Search an item, 
4. Show # of Un-sold items in list,
5. Display unsold items (In-order),
6. Display Unsold itemsin preorder,
7. Display unsold items in post-order,
8. Display list of sold items,
9. Quit the program. 
The program itself will update the inventory if any data is changed in terms of sold and unsold. You are invited to test this program. If you want to read-in a list of text files you could. Just add that in the commandline. However, the program runs without the pre-made text file and you can make your own list from a scratch! Thank you and enjoy.


## How To Run
Download the zipfile that I've uploaded and you will have 1 header file with 2 cpp files.
Use those all and compile into one program. The program will run fine.

## Dependencies
Only needs 1 header file and 2 cpp files.



## System Requirements
Runs on MAC, Windows, Linux using codeblocks, geany, etc.
