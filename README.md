## Project Summary

For this project, I am going to create a shopping program to allow a user to add items, remove items, and show items sold, what items are not sold and finally show the user what items are in the inventory with a counting number. I am going to use what we learned before and utilize 'display the current items in inventory', 'add the item with a name', 'delete the item with a name', 'count the number of items in inventory', 'clear inventory' and 'exit'. The program itself will update the inventory if any data is changed in terms of sold and unsold. You are invited to test this program. Thank you and enjoy.
